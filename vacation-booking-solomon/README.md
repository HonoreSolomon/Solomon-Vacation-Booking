### Vacation Booking Software - Full-Stack Development Project

As part of my recent project, I developed a comprehensive **Vacation Booking Software** using a full-stack architecture with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. 

#### Key Contributions:
- **Backend Development**: Utilized **Spring Framework** to design RESTful services, managing database interactions using **JPA**. Implemented multithreading for real-time booking and notifications.
- **Frontend Development**: Developed a dynamic user interface with **Angular**, enhancing user experience with responsive design and smooth user interactions.
- **Database Management**: Built and optimized relational databases with **MySQL**, implementing complex **OneToMany** and **ManyToOne** relationships for seamless vacation and booking management.
- **Customer & Division Management**: Leveraged Hibernate ORM to manage relationships between customers, divisions, and vacations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- **Session Handling**: Addressed and resolved lazy initialization issues by ensuring proper session management within the Hibernate framework.

This project highlights my ability to handle full-stack development, work with internationalization, and deliver scalable, user-friendly solutions. I am eager to bring my skills to an internship in a challenging environment.
